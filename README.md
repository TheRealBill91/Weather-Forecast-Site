# Weather-Forecast-Site

This is a simple site that uses weatherapi.com to display weather information for any location. You can search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The site also changes the look of the page based on the data.

## About

This project is based on a tutorial from The Odin Project, which is a free online curriculum for learning full-stack web development. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive web page. It also uses webpack to bundle and serve the files.
